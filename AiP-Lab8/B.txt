The lonely sail is showing white 
 Among the haze of the blue sea!.. 
 What does it search in foreign part?
What left it in the native land?.. 

The waves are playing, wind is whistling,
 And bending mast is creaking loud, 
Alas, – it does not hunt for pleasure 
And nor from pleasure does it run! 

 Below – a bright stream of azure, 
 Above – a golden beam of sun,
But it, rebellious, asks for tempests 
 As if the tempests give a rest!

 by Mikhail Lermontov,
